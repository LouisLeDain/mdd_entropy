# Comparing the performance of Entropy minimization and Pseudo-labeling unsupervised methods for MDD

This repositery contains the code to execute the experiments comparing conditional entropy minimization, as described in [Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10653) and Momentum Pseudo-Labeling for Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis.

# Installation

To install the required packages, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

To run the experiments, you can use the following command:

```bash
python run_experiments.py
